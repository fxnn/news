# API Key - SECURITY NOTICE:
# Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Use environment variable
#   Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and leave api_key empty
#   This prevents accidentally committing your API key to version control
#
# Option 2: Store in config file (less secure)
#   Set api_key below, but NEVER commit this file to git
#   *.toml files are gitignored by default
